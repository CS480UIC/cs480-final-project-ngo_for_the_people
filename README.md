# Database description
A database management system for spreading awareness and to maximise funds by maintaining a transparent chain of funds between giver and reciever.  The database system will manage and maintain records of entities like list of donors (donation_id, reciever_id, names, affiliation, details, donated amount, contact, date of donation) under funding. In case of external funding from companies, businesses or any other corporate field a similar entity - attribute relation will be maintained. In terms of receivers, the database management system aims to maintain records of different departments such as education and healthcare in different geographical areas(country code, state ID). The healthcare sector is managed by the organisation for which the database will keep a record of surgeries, number of people who are in need and many more to it. The education sector can have the details of schools, level of education, tutors, students. 
Along with donation, the database will also maintain a record of active volunteers(name, age, contact, address) of a particular region, making them accessible to different events as well and keep a track of all the funds. The organisation also will have campaigns for different causes and the database will have all the information related to the event.
Different software systems can utilise this database to understand the poverty ratio in different regions, thereby to understand where resources are required the most. The datasets will be useful for data analysis and reporting. Understanding the improvement of a particular region will help understand the development rate. The database scope mainly focuses on the flow of funds to a sundry of receivers depending on the need and requirement.
The platform helps to redirect funds to multiple sources and unlike generic systems, it does  not focus on one sector only. There are no such centralised systems which aid the need of maintaining current records and help maximize funds while maintaining transparency, thereby currently there are no solutions for the said problem. Education systems, hunger sustainability, transparent resource management are few of the many approaches achievable by the database system.
